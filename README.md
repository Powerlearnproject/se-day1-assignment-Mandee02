#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a discipline of engineering that uses clearly defined scientific ideas, methods, and procedures to produce software products.  It involves more than just coding; it involves creating dependable systems that address practical issues.  Software powers everything we use, from laptops and cellphones to large industrial systems. The main purpose of software engineering is to develop reliable, efficient, and scalable software solutions to meet the needs of users and businesses effectively.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Software Crisis (1960sâ€“70s): emphasized the difficulties of managing large, complicated software projects.  It led to the realization that software development required a more disciplined, engineering-oriented approach.  
The Rise of Structured Programming (1970s-1980s): Techniques such as modular design and structured programming languages (such as Pascal and C) appeared, enhancing code organization and maintainability.  This stage simplified code for better understanding and management. 
 The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Agile Methodologies (1990s-2000s): OOP, using languages such as Java and C++, enabled improved code reuse and modeling of real-world things.  Agile techniques, such as Scrum and XP, prioritized iterative development, collaboration, and adaptability to change.  This move made software development much more versatile.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements Gathering: Outlining the project's goals and user requirements.
Design: Developing the user interface, architecture and data structures.
Implementation (Coding): Writing the actual code based on the design.
Testing: Confirming the performance and functionality of the software
Deployment:  Giving users access to the software.
Maintenance: Fixing bugs, adding features, and providing ongoing support.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: A method that is sequential and linear.  Before moving on to the next phase, each one must be finished.  Ideal for projects (such as embedded systems and critical infrastructure) with clear specifications and little modifications.  
Agile: A gradual, iterative methodology that prioritizes adaptability and teamwork.  Ideal for projects that require rapid adaption and have changing requirements (e.g., web applications, mobile apps).

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Writes and maintains code, implements features, and solves technical problems.
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Tests software,  identify and report bugs, ensuring quality.
Project Manager: Plans, organizes, and oversees the project, ensuring it's delivered on time and within budget.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Boost developer productivity by offering coding, debugging, and testing capabilities.  Examples include Eclipse, Visual Studio, and IntelliJ IDEA.  
Version Control Systems (VCS): Monitor code modifications to facilitate teamwork and guard against data loss.  Examples include SVN and Git (GitHub, GitLab).  They are necessary for safe code management and teamwork.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenge: Tight deadlines.
   Strategy: Prioritize tasks, use Agile methodologies, and communicate effectively.
Challenge: Bugs and errors.
   Strategy:  Practice code reviews, employ debugging tools, and conduct extensive testing.  
 Challenge: Evolving requirements.
   Strategy: Embrace Agile approaches, preserve flexibility, and communicate with stakeholders.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing individual components of the code.
Integration Testing: Testing how different components interact with each other.
System Testing: Testing the entire system to ensure it meets the requirements.
Acceptance Testing: Testing by end-users to ensure the software meets their needs. Each of these tests is a layer of defense against bugs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the art of crafting effective prompts for AI models. It's about understanding how the model interprets language and tailoring your input to get the desired outputs.  Well-crafted prompts can significantly improve the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague: "Create an image."
   This task is too broad. The AI has no idea what kind of image to generate.
 Clear: "Create a digital picture of a sunset over a mountain range, with warm colors and a realistic style. The image should have a resolution of 1920x1080."
   This provides details about the subject, style, color palette, and resolution, leading to a much more targeted and desirable image.
